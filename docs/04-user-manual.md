# User Manual: Oracle AI Assistant

**Target Audience:** End Users (Legal, Sales, Executives)

## 1. Overview
Oracle is your AI-powered contract assistant. It reads your contracts so you don't have to search manually. It can answer questions, summarize clauses, and find specific deals.

## 2. How to Search Effectively

Oracle works best when you ask specific questions like you would to a colleague.

### ✅ Good Examples
-   "What is the liability cap in the Project Titan agreement?"
-   "List all contracts expiring next month with value over $50k."
-   "Summarize the termination clause in the Acme Corp NDA."
-   "How many contracts are pending legal review?"

### ❌ Bad Examples
-   "Tell me about contracts." (Too vague)
-   "Search." (No intent)
-   "Draft a new contract." (Oracle is currently read-only for analysis)

## 3. Understanding "Sources Used"

Transparency is key. When Oracle answers a question based on your documents, it will always cite its sources.

-   **Source Cards**: These appear below the answer bubble.
-   **Match %**: Indicates how confident the AI is. (e.g., "92% Match" means high confidence).
-   **Snippet**: A short preview of the exact text found.
-   **Verification**: Click the card to open the full contract and verify the answer yourself.

## 4. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can Oracle see my confidential contracts?**
A: Oracle only sees what **you** have access to. It respects all permission settings.

**Q: How up-to-date is the search?**
A: New contracts are usually searchable within 10-20 seconds of creation.

**Q: Can I search scanned PDFs?**
A: Currently, Oracle searches text-based contracts. Scanned image-only PDFs may not be fully indexed in this version.

**Q: Why did I get "No results found"?**
A: This usually means:
    1. The contract doesn't exist.
    2. You don't have permission to view it.
    3. The keywords didn't match closely enough. Try rephrasing.
